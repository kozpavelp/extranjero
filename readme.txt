It's telegram bot for me and my russian crew who emigrated to Peru. I'm adding options to it sometimes.
For now it shows how much soles for one dollar we can afford and transcript voice messages to text (because a hate voice messages, lol).
For proper work you have to install ffmpeg (sudo apt install ffmpeg) cause whisper needs mp3 files

- added option to parse Facebook and adondevivir for apartments. Return pages with apartments with inline buttons and ability to save offers into user archive
